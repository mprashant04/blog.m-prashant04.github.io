Flash duration becomes very imortant aspect, especially in high speed photography. 


One can easily build light sensing device using a simple photo-diode and 3.5mm audio jack. Connect -ve terminal of photo diode to ground and +ve terminal to center pin of audio jack. Plug it into mic input port of your PC and you are ready to record any optical pulses as an audio recording. I used Audacity, a free audio recording software, for recording optical pulses. Ensure to disable any type of microphone enhancement settings in the Windows sound settings. E.g. Realtek sound card drivers have enhancement setting called "DTS clear voice", which pre-processes microphone signals by default. We need clear input signal from microphone jack without any digital enhancements.
