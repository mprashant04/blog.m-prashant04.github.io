Lua is a powerful embeddable scripting language, which supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming and more. Lua is dynamically typed, run by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine. This makes Lua ideal for scripting and rapid prototyping. "Lua" literally means "Moon" in Portuguese. 

Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g. Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems and games (e.g. World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Lua is currently the leading scripting language in games.
